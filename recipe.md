Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Lightly grease a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with non stick spray


In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, oil, brown sugar, granulated sugar and lemon zest until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.


Add the eggs one at a time, mixing after each addition until fully incorporated, then scraping the side of the bowl before adding the next. Add the lemon oil and mix to combine.


In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add half the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix to combine. Add the sour cream and mix until incorporated, then add the remaining flour and mix to combine.


Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread into an even layer, then transfer to the oven. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (or with just a few moist crumbs), 50 minutes to 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then unmold onto a cooling rack to cool completely.




IF USING GLAZE :

In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar, lemon juice and cream to form a thick glaze.

It should fall off the spoon in a thick drizzle, but if it’s too thick, add more cream 1 tablespoon at a time until the glaze reaches the desired consistency. 

Spoon over the cooled loaf, then garnish with lemon zest.

Let set 15 minutes before slicing and serving.

NOTE: If you choose not to use the glaze, you can dress up the cake by garnishing the top with thin slices of Meyer lemon and a sprinkle of sparkling sugar or turbinado sugar before baking.
